# Linguistic Analysis on Song Lyrics (Ling 242 Project)

## 1. Use WordCloud to analyze Song Lyrics of Billboard Year-End Hot 100 (1965-2015) 

The dataset I am using is from: https://github.com/walkerkq/musiclyrics

With WordCloud, I find the most freqeuntly used words (ex. top 5 most used words). 
I label songs as "trendy songs" if they contain such words.

- Preprocessing: Tokenize and remove useless words
- POS tagging 
- Extract words with POS tags of noun, adjective, adverb
I am able to find the common keywords/topics of popular songs.

## 2. 
Train with the trendy song data and test what other songs also follow the trend. 
- Word representations and sentence classification
- Get training and test data, learn, evaluate

## 3. 
Maybe be able to generate new lyrics with these popular keywords using Markov Chain and graphs.
